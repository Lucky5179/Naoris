          personal information (such as name, country of residence, etc)You can choose not to provide us with your

          Users who are uncertain about what information is mandatory are welcome to contact us.<strong>Privacy of
            children</strong>We do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children under the age of 18. If
          you are under the age of 18, please do not submit any Personal Information through the Website and Services.
          If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 18 has provided Personal Information to us through
          the Website and Services, please contact us to request that we delete that child’s Personal Information from
          our Services.<br />We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us when you fill any forms on
          the Website. When required, this information may include the following:<br /><br />We encourage parents and
          legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing
          their children never to provide Personal Information through the Website and Services without their
          permission. We also ask that all parents and legal guardians overseeing the care of children take the
          necessary precautions to ensure that their children are instructed to never give out Personal Information when
          online without their permission.<strong>Use and processing of collected information</strong>We act as a data
          controller and a data processor in terms of the GDPR when handling Personal Information, unless we have
          entered into a data processing agreement with you in which case you would be the data controller and we would
          be the data processor.<br /><br />Our role may also differ depending on the specific situation involving
          Personal Information. We act in the capacity of a data controller when we ask you to submit your Personal
          Information that is necessary to ensure your access and use of the Website and Services. In such instances, we
          are a data controller because we determine the purposes and means of the processing of Personal Information
          and we comply with data controllers’ obligations set forth in the GDPR.<br /><br />We act in the capacity of a
          data processor in situations when you submit Personal Information through the Website and Services. We do not
          own, control, or make decisions about the submitted Personal Information, and such Personal Information is
          processed only in accordance with your instructions. In such instances, the User providing Personal
          Information acts as a data controller in terms of the GDPR.<br /><br />In order to make the Website and
          Services available to you, or to meet a legal obligation, we may need to collect and use certain Personal
          Information. If you do not provide the information that we request, we may not be able to provide you with the
          requested products or services. Any of the information we collect from you may be used for the following
          purposes:Account details (such as user name, unique user ID, password, etc)Send product and service
          updatesRespond to inquiries and offer supportRun and operate the Website and ServicesProcessing your Personal
          Information depends on how you interact with the Website and Services, where you are located in the world and
          if one of the following applies: (i) you have given your consent for one or more specific purposes; this,
          however, does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Information is subject to California Consumer
          Privacy Act or European data protection law; (ii) provision of information is necessary for the performance of
          an agreement with you and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof; (iii) processing is necessary for
          compliance with a legal obligation to which you are subject; (iv) processing is related to a task that is
          carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us; (v) processing is
          necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party.<br /><br />We rely
          on the following legal bases as defined in the GDPR upon which we collect and process your Personal
          Information:User’s consentOur own legitimate interestsNote that under some legislations we may be allowed to
          process information until you object to such processing by opting out, without having to rely on consent or
          any other of the legal bases above. In any case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that
          applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Information is a statutory or
          contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.<strong>Disclosure of
            information</strong>Depending on the requested Services or as necessary to complete any transaction or
          provide any Service you have requested, we may share your information with our affiliates, contracted
          companies, and service providers (collectively, “Service Providers”) we rely upon to assist in the operation
          of the Website and Services available to you and whose privacy policies are consistent with ours or who agree
          to abide by our policies with respect to Personal Information. We will not share any personally identifiable
          information with third parties and will not share any information with unaffiliated third
          parties.<br /><br />Service Providers are not authorized to use or disclose your information except as
          necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements. Service Providers are given the
          information they need only in order to perform their designated functions, and we do not authorize them to use
          or disclose any of the provided information for their own marketing or other purposes.<strong>Retention of
            information</strong>We will retain and use your Personal Information for the period necessary to comply with
          our legal obligations, to enforce our agreements, resolve disputes, and unless a longer retention period is
          required or permitted by law.<br /><br />We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your
          Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally.
          Once the retention period expires, Personal Information shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the
          right to erasure, the right to rectification, and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after the
          expiration of the retention period.<strong>Transfer of information</strong>Depending on your location, data
          transfers may involve transferring and storing your information in a country other than your own. However,
          this will not include countries outside the European Union and European Economic Area. If any such transfer
          takes place, you can find out more by checking the relevant sections of this Policy or inquire with us using
          the information provided in the contact section.<strong>Data protection rights under the GDPR</strong>If you
          are a resident of the European Economic Area (“EEA”), you have certain data protection rights and we aim to
          take reasonable steps to allow you to correct, amend, delete, or limit the use of your Personal Information.
          If you wish to be informed what Personal Information we hold about you and if you want it to be removed from
          our systems, please contact us. In certain circumstances, you have the following data protection
          rights:<br /><br />(i) You have the right to withdraw consent where you have previously given your consent to
          the processing of your Personal Information. To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your
          Personal Information is consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal will not
          affect the lawfulness of processing before the withdrawal.<br /><br />(ii) You have the right to learn if your
          Personal Information is being processed by us, obtain disclosure regarding certain aspects of the processing,
          and obtain a copy of your Personal Information undergoing processing.<br /><br />(iii) You have the right to
          verify the accuracy of your information and ask for it to be updated or corrected. You also have the right to
          request us to complete the Personal Information you believe is incomplete.<br /><br />(iv) You have the right
          to object to the processing of your information if the processing is carried out on a legal basis other than
          consent. Where Personal Information is processed for the public interest, in the exercise of an official
          authority vested in us, or for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us, you may object to such
          processing by providing a ground related to your particular situation to justify the objection.<br /><br />(v)
          You have the right, under certain circumstances, to restrict the processing of your Personal Information.
          These circumstances include: the accuracy of your Personal Information is contested by you and we must verify
          its accuracy; the processing is unlawful, but you oppose the erasure of your Personal Information and request
          the restriction of its use instead; we no longer need your Personal Information for the purposes of
          processing, but you require it to establish, exercise or defend your legal claims; you have objected to
          processing pending the verification of whether our legitimate grounds override your legitimate grounds. Where
          processing has been restricted, such Personal Information will be marked accordingly and, with the exception
          of storage, will be processed only with your consent or for the establishment, to exercise or defense of legal
          claims, for the protection of the rights of another natural, or legal person or for reasons of important
          public interest.<br /><br />(vi) You have the right, under certain circumstances, to obtain the erasure of
          your Personal Information from us. These circumstances include: the Personal Information is no longer
          necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed; you withdraw consent
          to consent-based processing; you object to the processing under certain rules of applicable data protection
          law; the processing is for direct marketing purposes; and the personal data have been unlawfully processed.
          However, there are exclusions of the right to erasure such as where processing is necessary: for exercising
          the right of freedom of expression and information; for compliance with a legal obligation; or for the
          establishment, to exercise or defense of legal claims.<br /><br />(vii) You have the right to receive your
          Personal Information that you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format
          and, if technically feasible, to have it transmitted to another controller without any hindrance from us,
          provided that such transmission does not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.<br /><br />(viii)
          You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your Personal
          Information. If you are not satisfied with the outcome of your complaint directly with us, you have the right
          to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority. For more information, please contact your
          local data protection authority in the EEA. This provision is applicable provided that your Personal
          Information is processed by automated means and that the processing is based on your consent, on a contract
          which you are part of, or on pre-contractual obligations thereof.<strong>California privacy
            rights</strong>Consumers residing in California are afforded certain additional rights with respect to their
          Personal Information under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”). If you are a California resident,
          this section applies to you.<br /><br />In addition to the rights as explained in this Policy, California
          residents who provide Personal Information as defined in the statute to obtain Services for personal, family,
          or household use are entitled to request and obtain from us, once a calendar year, information about the
          categories and specific pieces of Personal Information we have collected and
          disclosed.<br /><br />Furthermore, California residents have the right to request deletion of their Personal
          Information or opt-out of the sale of their Personal Information which may include selling, disclosing, or
          transferring Personal Information to another business or a third party for monetary or other valuable
          consideration. To do so, simply contact us. We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your rights
          under the CCPA.<strong>How to exercise your rights</strong>Any requests to exercise your rights can be
          directed to us through the contact details provided in this document. Please note that we may ask you to
          verify your identity before responding to such requests. Your request must provide sufficient information that
          allows us to verify that you are the person you are claiming to be or that you are the authorized
          representative of such person. If we receive your request from an authorized representative, we may request
          evidence that you have provided such an authorized representative with power of attorney or that the
          authorized representative otherwise has valid written authority to submit requests on your
          behalf.<br /><br />You must include sufficient details to allow us to properly understand the request and
          respond to it. We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information unless we first
          verify your identity or authority to make such a request and confirm that the Personal Information relates to
          you.<strong>Data analytics</strong>Our Website and Services may use third-party analytics tools that use
          cookies, web beacons, or other similar information-gathering technologies to collect standard internet
          activity and usage information. The information gathered is used to compile statistical reports on User
          activity such as how often Users visit our Website and Services, what pages they visit and for how long, etc.
          We use the information obtained from these analytics tools to monitor the performance and improve our Website
          and Services. We do not use third-party analytics tools to track or to collect any personally identifiable
          information of our Users and we will not associate any information gathered from the statistical reports with
          any individual User.<strong>Do Not Track signals</strong>Some browsers incorporate a Do Not Track feature that
          signals to websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. Tracking is not the
          same as using or collecting information in connection with a website. For these purposes, tracking refers to
          collecting personally identifiable information from consumers who use or visit a website or online service as
          they move across different websites over time. How browsers communicate the Do Not Track signal is not yet
          uniform. As a result, the Website and Services are not yet set up to interpret or respond to Do Not Track
          signals communicated by your browser. Even so, as described in more detail throughout this Policy, we limit
          our use and collection of your Personal Information.<strong>Email marketing</strong>We offer electronic
          newsletters to which you may voluntarily subscribe at any time. We are committed to keeping your e-mail
          address confidential and will not disclose your email address to any third parties except as allowed in the
          information use and processing section or for the purposes of utilizing a third-party provider to send such
          emails. We will maintain the information sent via e-mail in accordance with applicable laws and
          regulations.<br /><br />In compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act, all e-mails sent from us will clearly state who
          the e-mail is from and provide clear information on how to contact the sender. You may choose to stop
          receiving our newsletter or marketing emails by following the unsubscribe instructions included in these
          emails or by contacting us.<strong>Links to other resources</strong>The Website and Services contain links to
          other resources that are not owned or controlled by us. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the
          privacy practices of such other resources or third parties. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the
          Website and Services and to read the privacy statements of each and every resource that may collect Personal
          Information.<strong>Information security</strong>We secure information you provide on computer servers in a
          controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We maintain reasonable
          administrative, technical, and physical safeguards in an effort to protect against unauthorized access, use,
          modification, and disclosure of Personal Information in our control and custody. However, no data transmission
          over the Internet or wireless network can be guaranteed.<br /><br />Therefore, while we strive to protect your
          Personal Information, you acknowledge that (i) there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet
          which are beyond our control; (ii) the security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data
          exchanged between you and the Website and Services cannot be guaranteed; and (iii) any such information and
          data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party, despite best efforts.<strong>Data
            breach</strong>In the event we become aware that the security of the Website and Services has been
          compromised or Users’ Personal Information has been disclosed to unrelated third parties as a result of
          external activity, including, but not limited to, security attacks or fraud, we reserve the right to take
          reasonably appropriate measures, including, but not limited to, investigation and reporting, as well as
          notification to and cooperation with law enforcement authorities. In the event of a data breach, we will make
          reasonable efforts to notify affected individuals if we believe that there is a reasonable risk of harm to the
          User as a result of the breach or if notice is otherwise required by law. When we do, we will send you an
          email.<strong>Changes and amendments</strong>We reserve the right to modify this Policy or its terms related
          to the Website and Services at any time at our discretion. When we do, we will revise the updated date at the
          bottom of this page. We may also provide notice to you in other ways at our discretion, such as through the
          contact information you have provided.<br /><br />An updated version of this Policy will be effective
          immediately upon the posting of the revised Policy unless otherwise specified. Your continued use of the
          Website and Services after the effective date of the revised Policy (or such other act specified at that time)
          will constitute your consent to those changes. However, we will not, without your consent, use your Personal
          Information in a manner materially different from what was stated at the time your Personal Information was
          collected.<strong>Acceptance of this policy</strong>You acknowledge that you have read this Policy and agree
          to all its terms and conditions. By accessing and using the Website and Services and submitting your
          information you agree to be bound by this Policy. If you do not agree to abide by the terms of this Policy,
          you are not authorized to access or use the Website and Services.<strong>Contacting us</strong>If you have any
          questions regarding the information we may hold about you or if you wish to exercise your rights, you may use
          the following data subject request form to submit your request:<br /><br /><a

          have any other questions, concerns, or complaints regarding this Policy, we encourage you to contact us using
          the details below:<br /><br />admin@naoris.com<br /><br />We will attempt to resolve complaints and disputes
